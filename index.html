              bring joy to others while raising money for charity through 
              Minecraft. Water is a human right, so by raising awareness and
            supporting safe water, we help those in need. Your donation can help
          give safe water in communities that need it, also supporting the idea that
          clean water should be prioritized for all</h4>
